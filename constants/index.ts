For instance, when users search for 'car,' the data is downloaded. Subsequently, if you search for another term like 'home,' new data is fetched. However, if they search for 'car' again, the data is accessed from the cache instead of being downloaded anew. This approach optimizes data usage and improves performance. Additionally, the application features a history page where all previous search terms are stored.",
